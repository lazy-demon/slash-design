slash-design is a powerful and confidential digital forensics and online investigation tool designed exclusively for our organization's needs. It serves as a critical asset for our investigative teams, enabling in-depth analysis and insights from various online platforms and data sources.

## Tools

üíæ  Docker: Containerization platform for seamless app development. <br>
üõ†Ô∏è  dart:   <br>
üõ†Ô∏è  flutter:   <br> 
üõ†Ô∏è  Serverpod:   <br>
üêã  PostgreSQL: Powerful open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). <br>
üßÆ  Visual Studio Code: Versatile multi-languege code editor with support for plugins and Dev Containers.<br> 

## Getting Started

The setup for slash-design has been simplified by using Docker. You only need to install docker and the Dev Container will configure itself!

### Prerequisites

* Docker

   ```sh
   winget install -e --id Docker.DockerDesktop
  ```

* Visual Studio Code

   ```sh
   winget install -e --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
  ```

### Setup
1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Clone this repo. VSC will ask you if you want to re-open the project in a Dev Container.
2. Click on üûÇ to start the client and database.
3. Open localhost:8080 as asked by VSC.

## Roadmap

* [x] Finish README
